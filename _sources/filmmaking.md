While my primary career has been in games, I've also explored creative expression through acting and film production. Here's a snapshot of my experience in front of and behind the camera.

## ðŸŽ­ Acting Credits (Supporting Artist)

### **The Crown â€“ Season 4, Episode 2: "The Balmoral Test"**  
**Role**: Balmoral Footman  
**Production**: Netflix | Left Bank Pictures  
**Director**: Paul Whittington  
Set during Margaret Thatcher and Princess Diana's first visit to Balmoral Castle, this episode explores the tensions between monarchy and politics. I appeared as a footman serving in the royal household. As a good footman should be, I was mainly just out of shot (including standing beside Prince Charles and Diana as they share this awkward goodbye), but did feature in a close-up at the end of the episode that really showed off my footman hairdo (make it heavier around the ears).

Whether on a professional set or indie production, Iâ€™ve found acting and filmmaking to be a rewarding creative counterbalance to my work in games.
