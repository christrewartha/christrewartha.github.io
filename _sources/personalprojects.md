# üõ†Ô∏è Personal Projects

Beyond professional game development, I enjoy exploring side projects that let me blend nostalgia, tech, storytelling, and play. These personal experiments span genres, platforms, and disciplines‚Äîfrom retro remakes and Unreal prototypes to AI tools and documentary storytelling.

## üéÆ Wipeout '60s *(PC, Unreal Engine 5)*

A retrofuturist take on the iconic anti-gravity racing series.  
**Wipeout '60s** reimagines the franchise as if antigravity tech had emerged in the golden age of motorsport. Think 1960s F1 garagistes meets high-speed hovercraft. Inspired by *The Force Awakens'* treatment of classic Star Wars vehicles, this version grounds the racing in physical interaction‚Äîpuddles splash, gravel spits, haybales tumble. The sleek veneer of sci-fi racing gives way to something grittier, more tactile, and deeply stylish.

- Developed in **Unreal Engine 5**
- Focus on dynamic surfaces: rain, gravel, mud, water spray
- Ships are physically grounded, with tactile feedback loops
- Emphasis on '60s visual design and practical effects vibe

## üß± West Bank DS *(Nintendo DS Homebrew)*

A loose remake of the ZX Spectrum classic *West Bank* using Nintendo DS homebrew tools.  
Players use the touchscreen for aiming, while action plays out on the top screen. The project experiments with input ergonomics  under tight hardware constraints.

- Built with the **devkitPro** toolchain  
- AI-generated pixel art, filtered to monochrome for visual clarity  
- Balancing and progression mechanics still in progress  
- Planned future port to VR‚Äîsimple, reflex-based gameplay lends itself well to new interfaces

## üèà NFL Fantasy App *(Web, JavaScript)*

A fantasy football web app that brings the **Premier League Fantasy** format to the **NFL**.  
Build a team within a salary cap, manage weekly transfers, and optimize for maximum points. It combines game design systems thinking with front-end web development.

- Written in **vanilla JavaScript** and deployed as a single-page app  
- Backend logic supports team budgets, transfers, and weekly stat aggregation  
- Inspired by classic FPL systems but adapted for NFL rules and pacing

## üõ∏ DJI Tello Drone Controller *(Python + OpenCV)*

A PC-based controller for the DJI Tello drone that adds basic computer vision capabilities.  
Users can control the drone using keyboard or gamepad, while facial recognition via OpenCV enables the drone to track and maintain position relative to a subject.

- Built using the **Tello SDK** in Python  
- Real-time face detection via **OpenCV Haar cascades**  
- Drone enters ‚Äúlock-on‚Äù mode, keeping a fixed distance and orientation to target  
- Good proof-of-concept for CV-enhanced drone workflows

## üé• Winston Churchill in Dundee *(Ken Burns-style Documentary)*

A historical documentary that explores Winston Churchill‚Äôs time as **MP for Dundee** (1908‚Äì1922).  
Told in a **Ken Burns** narrative style with archival photos, voiceover, and subtle panning, the film touches on Churchill‚Äôs clash with local suffragettes, his WWI legacy, and his eventual defeat by prohibitionist Edwin Scrymgeour.

- Structured around key moments: election, WWI, suffrage movement, post-war politics  
- Frames Dundee as an unexpected yet telling chapter in Churchill‚Äôs career  
- Explores the role of working-class politics, civic identity, and changing norms  
- Work-in-progress, intended for narrative pacing and storytelling experimentation
